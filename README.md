# Open Opportunity Project

The **Open Opportunity Project**’s goal is to be a resource for applied personal growth. It will be considered successful if it contains a knowledge base upon which one might reasonably expect to be able to offer coaching and mentoring to another person - or indeed offer learning resources that support an individual’s growth.

## Motivation

Some people genuinely want to grow and improve. 

Some people want to support others in their growth and improvement.

The dynamic between these two motives, it could be argued, is absolutely invaluable to our overall progress and growth as humans.

With today’s technology - the foundational knowledge that serves this greater good can be shared feely.

We recognise that the delivery and application of this knowledge is time consuming, and thus a valid career pursuit - but, so is software development, and get it is entirely possible to become a successful programmer (and implement those things learn) by consuming entirely open source knowledge.

This project attempts to contribute a similar value to those learning for themselves, and with the eventual aim of providing service to others.
